Project: Austin Airbnb Listings and Reviews Analysis

Living in Texas, I’ve found that Austin is a fantastic destination, full of unique experiences and vibrant culture. After staying in an Airbnb there, I was inspired to dive into Airbnb data for Austin to understand what makes a great guest experience in this popular vacation spot and uncover additional business insights. Using open-source data from Inside Airbnb, I analyzed thousands of listings and reviews to uncover insights that could benefit hosts, property managers, and future guests. Here’s a quick look at the project: Data Loading and Transformation: Imported and processed 10,000+ listings and 630,000+ reviews into Microsoft SQL Server, allowing for scalable analysis. Sentiment Analysis: Used Python’s NLP libraries to classify guest reviews as positive, neutral, or negative. This provided insight into which properties receive the most positive feedback and where there might be areas for improvement. SQL Analysis for Key Insights: Identified top-earning listings, explored host performance in cleanliness, and analyzed occupancy trends. These insights help optimize guest satisfaction and property management decisions.
Skills Used: SQL, Python, Sentiment Analysis (TextBlob), Data Processing (Pandas), Word Cloud Generation
